# Lane-Detection-and-Tracking-for-Self-Driving-Vehicles
This project, titled "Lane Detection and Tracking for Self-Driving Vehicles," was undertaken as part of the Bachelor of Engineering degree requirements at the Global Academy of Technology, affiliated with Visvesvaraya Technological University. The primary goal is to develop an advanced system capable of detecting and tracking road lanes to enhance the safety and efficiency of self-driving vehicles.

Abstract

Monitoring road conditions has gained significant importance in recent years due to various factors such as aiding drivers in decision-making, reducing vehicle damage, and providing valuable data to road management authorities. This project leverages a real-time IoT complex with an Android application to automatically collect data from a mobile device's triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope, displaying road traces on a geographic map using GPS, and sending data to cloud-based computation algorithms. Various artificial neural networks are applied to classify road segments and build a model with consistent accuracy above 90%. The outcome is a visual representation of road quality in a selected region, providing feedback to drivers and local authorities. The system offers long-term benefits by allowing comparisons of road network conditions over different periods and evaluating road construction projects for compliance with quality standards​​.

Introduction

The project addresses the critical problem of road recognition for smart cars and road services. Effective road maintenance is crucial for safety and requires substantial resources. By implementing advanced lane detection and tracking algorithms, this project aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of autonomous driving systems. The project identifies limitations in existing systems and proposes enhancements to overcome these challenges​​.

Objectives

To develop a robust system for detecting and tracking road lanes in real-time.
To utilize IoT devices and machine learning algorithms for data collection and processing.
To provide accurate and reliable information on road conditions to improve decision-making for self-driving vehicles​​.

Methodology

The system architecture integrates various components, including sensors for data acquisition, a mobile application for real-time processing, and cloud-based algorithms for data analysis. Key algorithms used include the Canny Edge Detector and the Hough Transform, which are essential for accurate lane detection. The project follows a systematic approach, from requirement analysis and system design to implementation and testing​​.

Results

The project demonstrates a high level of accuracy in lane detection and tracking, with consistent performance metrics. The experimental setup and results indicate that the system can reliably classify road segments and provide real-time feedback, thus enhancing the operational safety of self-driving vehicles​​.

Conclusion

The lane detection and tracking system developed in this project offers significant improvements over existing solutions, providing accurate, real-time information on road conditions. Future enhancements could include expanding the dataset for training machine learning models and integrating additional sensors to improve system robustness​​.
