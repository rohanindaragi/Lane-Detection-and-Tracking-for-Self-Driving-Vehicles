# Lane-Detection-and-Tracking-for-Self-Driving-Vehicles
This project, titled "Lane Detection and Tracking for Self-Driving Vehicles," was undertaken as part of the Bachelor of Engineering degree requirements at the Global Academy of Technology, affiliated with Visvesvaraya Technological University. The primary goal is to develop an advanced system capable of detecting and tracking road lanes to enhance the safety and efficiency of self-driving vehicles.

Abstract

Monitoring road conditions has gained significant importance in recent years due to various factors such as aiding drivers in decision-making, reducing vehicle damage, and providing valuable data to road management authorities. This project leverages a real-time IoT complex with an Android application to automatically collect data from a mobile device's triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope, displaying road traces on a geographic map using GPS, and sending data to cloud-based computation algorithms. Various artificial neural networks are applied to classify road segments and build a model with consistent accuracy above 90%. The outcome is a visual representation of road quality in a selected region, providing feedback to drivers and local authorities. The system offers long-term benefits by allowing comparisons of road network conditions over different periods and evaluating road construction projects for compliance with quality standards​​.
